# Optimization Plan and Historical Status

This file documents optimization work and its current status against the stable baseline.

## Current Baseline

- Primary runtime file: `traceguard_ai_community.py`
- Version in runtime metadata: 1.1.4

## Completed Optimizations (Implemented)

1. Concurrency controls
- Fixed-size thread pool for analysis tasks
- Global semaphore cap for AI calls
- Per-host semaphore caps to reduce host-level request bursts

2. Persistent caching and reuse
- Request-signature hashing to skip repeated AI calls
- Persistent cache on disk with dirty-flag write strategy

3. Provider dispatch hardening
- Provider-specific adapters and connection checks
- Configurable timeout for outbound provider requests

4. Response parsing resilience
- Structured JSON parsing with repair fallback for malformed model output

5. Export and operational usability
- CSV export with stable filename pattern
- Console/task visibility for runtime behavior

## Active Risk Areas

1. UI thread safety regressions
- Continue enforcing Swing updates on EDT only

2. Semaphore ordering regressions
- Maintain host semaphore acquisition before global semaphore in standard analysis path

3. Config/schema migration drift
- Keep `CONFIG_VERSION` and migration logic aligned

## Forward Work

1. Consolidate variant strategy
- Decide whether v2 variants should be promoted or remain experimental

2. Expand repeatable benchmark matrix
- Capture comparable provider performance with fixed traffic sets

3. Optional test harness strategy
- Add non-Burp helper checks where feasible (parser/unit helpers)
