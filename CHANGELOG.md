## [1.0.6] - 2025-01-31

### Changed
- **Increased timeout maximum to 99999 seconds** (27.7 hours)

- UI change: Control panel now has 5 buttons (was 6)
  - Settings, Clear Completed, Cancel All, Pause All, Upgrade
  - Debug Tasks moved to Settings → Advanced tab
- Binary content handling:
  - Uses `self.helpers.bytesToString()` instead of `.tostring()`
  - Catches all decode exceptions
  - Logs decode errors in verbose mode
  - Falls back to placeholder text
- Timeout help text updated to show new range

### User Impact
- **No more stuck tasks on binary content** (images, PDFs, zips, etc.)
