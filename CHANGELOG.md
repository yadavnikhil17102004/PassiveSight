# Changelog - TRACEGUARD AI™ Community Edition

All notable changes to the TRACEGUARD AI™ Community Edition will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog]([REDACTED_URL]),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning]([REDACTED_URL]).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed - Critical (P0)
- **CRITICAL: `doPassiveScan()` bypasses thread pool** - Raw threading spawned in passive scan ignored the thread pool entirely
  - Changed from `threading.Thread(target=self.analyze, ...)` to thread pool submission
  - Now properly queues all passive scan analysis through `AnalyzeTask` and thread pool
  - Prevents resource exhaustion from unlimited thread spawning
- **CRITICAL: Semaphore deadlock risk** - Global and per-host semaphores acquired in wrong order
  - Changed acquisition order: now acquires host semaphore before global (narrow before wide)
  - Prevents threads holding global slots from blocking on host locks
  - Eliminates silent hangs under concurrent load
- **CRITICAL: `_migrate_config()` crashes on startup** - Calls `save_config()` before `stdout` wrapper is initialized
  - Removed `save_config()` call from `_migrate_config()` — migration auto-persists on next settings save
  - Prevents `AttributeError` on stdout access during initial config load

### Fixed - High (P1)
- **`_store_cached_findings()` blocks analysis threads with synchronous disk writes** - Every finding triggered immediate file I/O
  - Changed to set `_cache_dirty = True` flag only, letting async timer handle writes
  - Removed `self.save_vuln_cache()` blocking call
  - Analysis threads now proceed without waiting for disk I/O
- **`_async_save_cache()` race condition** - Cache dirty flag cleared before background write could complete
  - Now clears flag optimistically before spawn (acceptable for async write)
  - Background thread re-queues on failure by setting `_cache_dirty = True` again
  - Added exception handling to prevent lost findings
- **Context menu analysis still uses raw threading** - `analyzeFromContextMenu()` spawned threads instead of using pool
  - Created `ForcedAnalyzeTask` runnable class for context menu operations
  - Now submits through thread pool like passive scan (after fix)
- **MD5 still used in 3 places** - Weak hash in request/finding signature generation
  - `_get_url_hash()`: Changed MD5 → SHA-256 (took first 32 chars for compatibility)
  - `_get_finding_hash()`: Changed MD5 → SHA-256 (full hash)
  - `_analyzeFromContextMenuThread()`: Changed MD5 → SHA-256 for request hash
  - Improves collision resistance and security posture
- **AI response `param` field ignored** - Prompt asks AI to identify vulnerable parameters but findings never displayed them
  - Added extraction of `ai_param = item.get("param", "")` from AI findings
  - Now displays as `<b>Vulnerable Parameter (AI):</b> <code>{param}</code>` in finding details
  - Helps pentesters quickly identify the exact vulnerable parameter

### Added - Medium (P2)
- **Security header coverage** - Added AI prompt categories for common header misconfigurations
  - New categories: "Missing security headers - CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options"
  - New categories: "Sensitive data in responses - PII, tokens, internal paths, debug info"
  - New categories: "API versioning issues - v1/v2 endpoints with different access controls"
  - AI now checks response headers systematically
- **IDOR parameter detection** - Detects common IDOR-vulnerable parameter names
  - Checks for patterns: `id`, `user_id`, `account_id`, `order_id`, `invoice_id`, `file_id`, `doc_id`, `record_id`, `item_id`, `uid`, `pid`, `customer_id`, `profile_id`, `token`, `ref`, `key`
  - Generates IDOR signal when detected: `{"type": "idor_param_name", "name": "...", "value": "..."}`
  - Complements numeric ID detection for better IDOR findings

### Improved - Low (P3)
- **Claude connection test was fake** - `_test_claude_connection()` hardcoded success without verifying API
  - Now sends actual test request: `{"model": "...", "max_tokens": 5, "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "ping"}]}`
  - Properly handles HTTP 429 (rate limited but reachable) vs actual failures
  - Prints clear feedback: "OK Claude API verified" or specific error message
  - Catches both connection and rate-limit conditions

### Planned
- Stream AI responses for faster perceived performance
- Support for custom AI models (local fine-tuned models)
- Export findings to PDF/HTML reports
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines
- Custom vulnerability templates

---

## [1.1.4] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- **Azure Foundry provider support** - Added Azure AI Foundry (Azure OpenAI-compatible) as a first-class AI provider in Settings
  - New provider option: `Azure Foundry`
  - Default endpoint helper: `[REDACTED_URL]`
  - Added provider routing for connection tests and AI inference requests
  - Supports deployment discovery via Azure deployments API in Test Connection
  - Supports direct chat completion calls with API version handling
- **Azure .env validation script** - Added `tools/test_azure_env.sh` for safe local configuration checks
  - Validates required `.env` keys
  - Probes Azure endpoint and deployment chat completion reachability
  - Reports clear `STATUS: VALID` or `STATUS: INVALID`

### Changed
- **Configuration help text expanded** - Settings now documents Azure Foundry endpoint and deployment-name usage
- **Documentation updated** - README, Quick Start, and Installation guides now include Azure Foundry setup

### User Impact
- Users can run TRACEGUARD with Azure-hosted OpenAI deployments from Azure AI Foundry
- Existing providers (Ollama, OpenAI, Claude, Gemini) continue to work as before

---

## [1.1.3] - 2026-02-08

### Changed
- **UI title updated** - Now displays "TRACEGUARD AI™ - Community Edition v1.1.3" with trademark symbol and version number
- **Updated slogan** - Changed from "AI-Powered Security Scanner" to "AI-Powered OWASP Top 10 Vulnerability Scanning for Burp Suite"
- **Button colors removed** - All control buttons (Settings, Cancel All, Pause All, Upgrade to Professional, Run Task Diagnostics) now use default system theme colors instead of custom colored backgrounds
- **"Check for Updates" renamed to "Upgrade to Professional"** - Clearer call-to-action for edition upgrade
- **"Default" console theme removed** - Simplified theme options to "Light" and "Dark" only
  - "Light" theme is now the default for new installations
  - Existing configs with "Default" theme are automatically migrated to "Light"

### Technical Details
- Removed `setBackground()` and `setForeground()` calls from 5 buttons: Settings, Cancel All, Pause All, Upgrade, Debug Tasks
- Theme combo options reduced from `["Default", "Dark", "Light"]` to `["Light", "Dark"]`
- `applyConsoleTheme()` simplified to two branches (Dark/Light) instead of three
- `load_config()` now validates saved theme value and falls back to "Light" if unrecognized
- Console logo updated with new slogan text

### User Impact
- **Cleaner UI** - Buttons integrate with the system look-and-feel instead of using custom colors
- **Simpler theme selection** - Two clear choices instead of three overlapping options
- **Accurate branding** - Title now shows trademark symbol, version, and specific OWASP Top 10 focus

---

## [1.1.2] - 2026-02-06

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: 145MB config file causes startup hang and settings freeze** - The `api_key` field in `~/.traceguard_config.json` was being corrupted to ~145MB
  - `JPasswordField.getPassword()` returns a Java `char[]`, and calling `str()` on it in Jython produces the array's repr (e.g. `"array(char, [u'a', u'r', ...])"`) instead of the actual password text
  - Each save-and-reload cycle recursively expanded the value, growing the config file exponentially
  - Fixed by using `"".join(apiKeyField.getPassword())` to properly convert the char array to a Python string
  - Affected both "Test Connection" and "Save Settings" code paths

### Technical Details
- `testConnection()` handler (line 1029): `str(apiKeyField.getPassword())` → `"".join(apiKeyField.getPassword())`
- `saveSettings()` handler (line 1194): `str(apiKeyField.getPassword())` → `"".join(apiKeyField.getPassword())`

### User Impact
- **Config file stays a few hundred bytes** instead of growing to 145MB+
- **Extension loads instantly** — no more startup hang from parsing a massive JSON file
- **Settings dialog opens instantly** — no more UI freeze from loading a corrupted API key
- **Note:** Users with a corrupted config file should delete `~/.traceguard_config.json` and re-enter their settings

---

## [1.1.1] - 2025-02-04

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Settings button freezes Burp Suite** - Clicking Settings caused the entire UI to hang
  - "Refresh Models" and "Test Connection" buttons called `test_ai_connection()` directly on the Swing EDT
  - Network requests with 10-second timeouts blocked all UI rendering while waiting for a response
  - Both buttons now run network calls in background threads with visual feedback ("..." / "Testing...")
  - Buttons are disabled during the operation and re-enabled when complete
- **Slow extension startup** - Loading the extension blocked Burp for up to 10 seconds
  - `test_ai_connection()` was called synchronously during `registerExtenderCallbacks()`
  - If the AI provider was unreachable, the full 10-second timeout had to elapse before Burp continued
  - Startup connection test now runs in a daemon background thread

### Technical Details
- `refreshModels()` handler: network call moved to daemon thread, UI updates via `SwingUtilities.invokeLater()`
- `testConnection()` handler: network call moved to daemon thread, button state restored in `finally` via EDT
- Startup `test_ai_connection()` wrapped in daemon thread, warning messages still printed on failure
- All three blocking paths now return immediately to the EDT

### User Impact
- **Settings dialog opens instantly** and remains responsive during connection tests
- **Extension loads instantly** without waiting for AI provider connectivity
- Buttons show visual feedback ("..." / "Testing...") while network operations run in background
- No more Burp Suite freezing when AI provider is slow or unreachable

---

## [1.1.0] - 2025-02-04

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: UI hang on Linux/Kali** - Burp Suite became unresponsive when running the extension on Linux systems
  - Swing Event Dispatch Thread (EDT) was saturated by unconditional UI refreshes every 2 seconds
  - Locks were held during Swing rendering, causing EDT to block on lock contention
  - Console rebuilt all 1,000 messages into a single string every refresh cycle
  - Redundant `time.sleep(4)` in analysis threads doubled request spacing unnecessarily

### Changed
- **Dirty-flag refresh guard** - `refreshUI()` now skips entirely when no data has changed
  - Added `_ui_dirty` flag set by all data mutation methods
  - Added `_refresh_pending` guard to prevent queueing multiple refreshes on the EDT
  - If nothing changed, zero Swing work is performed
- **Copy-then-render pattern** - Data is now snapshot under locks, then Swing components are updated with no locks held
  - Eliminates EDT blocking on `tasks_lock`, `findings_lock_ui`, `console_lock`, and `stats_lock`
- **Incremental console updates** - Only new messages are appended via `Document.insertString()`
  - Full text rebuild only on first load or when message list is trimmed
  - Reduces console update cost from O(n) to O(delta)
- **Refresh interval increased** - Auto-refresh timer changed from 2 seconds to 5 seconds
  - Stuck task check adjusted to every 6 cycles (~30 seconds) to match
- **Removed redundant sleeps** - Removed `time.sleep(4)` from `analyze()` and `analyze_forced()` finally blocks
  - The existing `min_delay = 4.0` rate limiter already enforces request spacing
- **Removed redundant `refreshUI()` call** from `add_finding()` - auto-refresh timer handles updates via dirty flag

### Technical Details
- Added instance variables: `_ui_dirty`, `_refresh_pending`, `_last_console_len`
- `refreshUI()` early-exits if `_refresh_pending` or not `_ui_dirty`
- `_refresh_pending` cleared in `finally` block of EDT Runnable to guarantee reset
- Dirty flag set in: `log_to_console()`, `add_finding()`, `addTask()`, `updateTask()`, `updateStats()`
- Console uses `Document.insertString()` for append, `setText()` only for full rebuild
- Handles message list trimming (when `current_len < prev_len`) by triggering full rebuild

### User Impact
- **Burp Suite no longer hangs on Kali Linux** and other Linux distributions
- Responsive UI even with hundreds of tasks and findings
- Lower CPU usage during idle periods (no unnecessary Swing work)
- Faster analysis throughput (no redundant 4-second sleep per request)
- Windows users also benefit from reduced EDT load
